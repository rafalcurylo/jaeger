Based on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-multi-container

AppServices limitation: only ports 80 and 443 are exposed.

Full jaeger (with client-server) failed to run.

I was able to run only client-server via app services with docker compose, however, ports were not exposed as I wanted.
Server app was exposed on 80, instead of client app, as I configured.

1. all services
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location "West Europe"
az appservice plan create --name myAppServicePlan --resource-group myResourceGroup --sku S1 --is-linux
git clone https://github.com/rafalcurylo/jaeger
cd jaeger
az webapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --name <app_name> --multicontainer-config-type compose --multicontainer-config-file docker-compose.yml

As suggested on google, I tried to isolate the problem bu running small portion of docer-compose.yml, but this was taking too much time and
logs from appServices still were not much helpful.

1. just client-server - run successfully
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location "West Europe"
az appservice plan create --name myAppServicePlan --resource-group myResourceGroup --sku S1 --is-linux
git clone https://github.com/rafalcurylo/jaeger
cd jaeger/jaxrsserver
vi docker-compose.yml and change client exposed port to 80
az webapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --name <app_name> --multicontainer-config-type compose --multicontainer-config-file docker-compose.yml

This worked OK. I was able to access sever application:
